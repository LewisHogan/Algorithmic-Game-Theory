# Algorithmic Game Theory

This repo contains my work on Algorithmic Game Theory.

## Task 1

Task 1 was focused on solving a zero sum game by removing dominated strategies from a matrix.

### Subtask A

Reduce the game as much as possible by eliminating any possible dominated strategies.

### Subtask B

Identity if there is a pure Nash equilibrium, and justify the answer.

## Task 2

Task two was focused on a zero sum game between two players.

## Subtask A

Identify if there is a Nash equilibrium and justify the answer.

## Subtask B

Calculate the optimal strategies for both the row player and the column player, showing the working.

## Task 3

Task 3 involved using linear equations to solve a probability matrix for a game where players are expected to follow a mediator.

## Task 4

Task 4 is split into two main subtasks:

### Subtask A

Calculating the optimal social welfare given a vector of revenue per click, click through rates at each slot and welfare per slot.

### Subtask B

Calculate the optimal bids for each player, and what the social welfare would be given those bids.
